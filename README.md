Project Title: title here (10 words maximum)
Statement

Describe your project. Why is it interesting? Why is it interesting to you personally? What do you hope to learn?

Analysis

Explain what approaches from class you will bring to bear on the project. Be explicit: e.g., will you use recursion? How? Will you use map/filter/reduce? How? Will you use data abstraction? Will you use object-orientation? Will you use functional approaches to processing your data? Will you use state-modification approaches? A combination?

The idea here is to identify what ideas from the class you will use in carrying out your project.

Data set or other source materials

If you will be working with existing data, where will you get those data from? (Dowload it from a website? access it in a database? create it in a simulation you will build....)

How will you convert that data into a form usable for your project?

Do your homework here: if you are pulling data from somewhere, actually go download it and look at it. Explain in some detail what your plan is for accomplishing the necessary processing.

If you are using some other starting materails, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

Deliverable and Demonstration

Explain exactly what you'll have at the end. What will it be able to do at the live demo?

What exactly will you produce at the end of the project? A piece of software, yes, but what will it do? Here are some questions to think about (and answer depending on your application).

Will it run on some data, like batch mode? Will you present some analytical results of the processing? How can it be re-run on different source data?

Will it be interactive? Can you show it working? This project involves a live demo, so interactivity is good.

Evaluation of Results

How will you know if you are successful? If you include some kind of quantitative analysis, that would be good.

Work Plan and Schedule

Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. Write your plan here.

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc.

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages, so take care in writing concrete steps for your schedule.

First Milestone (04-13)

What exactly will be turned in on this day?

Second Milestone (04-21)

What exactly will be turned in on this day?

Group Responsibilities

Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

Additional instructions for teams of three:

Remember that you must have prior written permission to work in groups of three (specifically, an approved FP3 team declaration submission).
The team must nominate a lead. This person is primarily responsible for code integration. This work may be shared, but the team lead has default responsibility.
The team lead has full partner implementation responsibilities also.
Identify who is team lead.
In the headings below, replace the silly names and GitHub handles with your actual ones.
