# Chess-Mates-Josh-and-Connor-

# Project Title: title here (10 words maximum)

### Statement

Connor and I are going to design and implement the rules and UI of chess.  Both Connor and I have some interest in the game of chess.  How it works, and the stratagey beyond the basic mindset of a chess player.  We hope to learn how to incorporate both back end and a visually appealing UI.  We also hope to learn how to use racket to solve complicated problems in a unique way.

### Analysis
Map/Filter/Reduce for tile representation.  A piece must know where it is on the board before it figures out the possible moves it can make.  Polymorphism for each piece thats responsible to know which moves it can make, and to know what piece it is.  Maybe identity functions?  Most back end coding will be enforcing both players to play by the rules.  
Closures to implement objects.

### Data set or other source materials
Were not (as of right now) going to be using any exterior data, besides using sprites for pieces.  Everything else is hard coded.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
In the end, we will have a functioning game of chess.  You will need two people to play this game because we are not planning on implementing an AI, but if time allows, we will look into networking.  It will definitely be an interactive program that will not run off specific data.  Maybe we will ask what the players names are before the game starts.  This will be speculated upon if time allows.

### Evaluation of Results
It will be a successful chess game if it forces the players to play by the rules of chess, and it does not crash.  Also, the game will be visually appealing.  If the user knows how to play chess, it should be obvious as to what they need to do.

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. 

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages.

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system. 

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)
**Conor:** 
Not all pieces working correctly, but having place holder functions implemented and full implementations for board and tile

**Josh:**
Having the board appear, and pieces on the board in the correct position.  Nothing would work, but the place holders are there and ready to go.
### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)
**Conor:**
Basic, unoptimized path finding functions for pieces.

**Josh:**
Having Conor's code work with mine.  On-click and on-key working and functioning.  Maybe an on-mouse-over to know where the mouse is and act accordingly.

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
Polishing off code.  Rooking and detection of checks and checkmates.  Working on green colored tiles to indicate proper moves.  Making sure everything works together, and bug fixing.  In depth testing.  BUG FIXING!  BUG FIXING!
## Group Responsibilities

**Conor:**
Conor will be handling back end, rule enforcing code.  He is the enforcer.

**Josh:**
Josh will be handling the UI chess board, making everything look nice and appealing the users.  He is the tailor.
