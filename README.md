Written Proposal Instructions

Teams will submit ONE written proposal, with sections that each member has done individually detailing their proposed contributions. The submission will be the README.md file in your brand-new project repository, which you'll make.

You must start using GitHub collaboratively from this point forward.

Instructions:

create a new repo as part of the oplS16projects organization; add your teammates to it
Copy the content from the template file into your README.md
Everyone on the team contributes their sections to your README.md file.
Send Fred/Mark the link to your new repository (exactly how TBD)
And now some detail on what to write in the report.

Overall guidance: You should be proposing something that you have high confidence that you can achieve, and the proposal should project that confidence.

The proposal should be no longer than necessary, but long enough to include critical detail. Three pages is appropriate. Diagrams are welcome.

Remember, you can do some neat formatting things with Markdown.

In case you missed it, here again is the template file

In-Class Presentation Instructions

Teams will each deliver an in-class presentation.

Your team will have two minutes to present. Create presentation with two or three slides. Make the slides in google drive, and share the public-viewable link with Mark/Fred (exactly how TBD). The day of presentations, I'll have the list of links on the display computer, so each team can simply click their link and begin.
